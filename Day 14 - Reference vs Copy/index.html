    let age2 = 100;

    age = 150;

    let name = 'Serg';
    let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Sergio', 'Eva', 'Michael', 'Lenin'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // team[3] = 'BoBo';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Sergio Vasil',
      age: 40
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
        // const captain = person;
        // captain.number = 90;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 } );
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sergio = {
        name: 'Sergio',
        age: 40,
        social: {
            twitter: '',
            facebook: ''
        }
    }
    console.clear();

    const dev = Object.assign({}, sergio); // This won't affect the second layer deep objects

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sergio) ); // shake off all the references
